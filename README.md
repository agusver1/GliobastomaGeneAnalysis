# GliobastomaGeneAnalysis
Software that analyses BioGrid gene dataset to analyse biological characteristics of the genes that interact with the Gliobastoma illness. It is based on the creation of a Graph with its nodes and edges with its features.
All the features and characteristics of the software are detailed in the Glioblastoma Gene Interaction Visualization Dashboard.pdf
This was a project done and supervised by the UCLouvain for the course Information Visualization.
The coding uses Python, Dash, Dash Cytoscape and HTML.
